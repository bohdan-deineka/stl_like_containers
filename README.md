# stl_like_containers

Here is my humble take on implementing versions of some of the popular STL containers from the scratch.

Planned containers:
1. Vector (done).
2. Linked list (partially done).
3. Double ended linked list.
4. Ring Buffer.

Suggestions about better code and/or containers to do next are always welcome. 

UPD: Planning to integrate full support of CMakeFiles soon.
